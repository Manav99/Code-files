### Attached is a dataset. We estimate the best model for the data provided by using a use a simple OLS regression, a polynomial regression, or a random forest
### These data are by country and represent how well political parties do in terms of securing cabinet seats in a coalition government. If a party receives 0 seats you can assume they are not in the coalition government; more than 0 indicates they are members. All parties prefer more seats to fewer. See: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government
### Target variable (Y) is cabinet_proportion â€“ the percentage of cabinet seats a party gets.

###################### Model 5- LASSO Regression with Train/Test split ######################

# In lasso the coefficients which are responsible for large variance are converted to zero. Lasso regression analysis is also used for variable selection as the model imposes coefficients of some variables to shrink towards zero.
# Important Note-
# The LASSO is not very good at handling variables which show correlation between them and thus can sometimes show very wild behaviors.
# Which is our case with data.

#Reference link- http://www.science.smith.edu/~jcrouser/SDS293/labs/lab10-r.html

# In order to fit a lasso model, we once again use the glmnet() function; however, this time we use the argument alpha<-1. 
# We now split the samples into a training set and a test set in order to estimate the test error of Lasso regression.
# Split the data into training and test set
set.seed(123)

# Shuffle the dataset, call the result shuffled
n <- nrow(data_num)
shuffled <- data_num[sample(n),]

#Splitting into train and test
train <- 1: round(.7*n)
test <- (round(.7*n)+1):n
train <- shuffled[train, ]
test <- shuffled[test, ]

y_train <-  train[,("cabinet_proportion")] %>%
  unlist() %>%
  as.numeric()

y_test <- test[,("cabinet_proportion")] %>%
  unlist() %>%
  as.numeric()

lasso_mod <-glmnet(x_train,  y_train,  alpha = 1) # Fit lasso model on training data
plot(lasso_mod)    # Draw plot of coefficients

cv.out = cv.glmnet(x_train, y_train, alpha = 1) # Fit lasso model on training data
plot(cv.out) # Draw plot of training MSE as a function of lambda
bestlam = cv.out$lambda.min # Select lamda that minimizes training MSE
lasso_pred = predict(lasso_mod, s = bestlam, newx = x_test) # Use best lambda to predict test data
mean((lasso_pred - y_test)^2) # Calculate test MSE
sqrt(mean((lasso_pred - y_test)^2)) # Calculate test RMSE

#Inference- This is little higher than the test set MSE of the RF model and Decision tree, and very similar to the test MSE of ridge regression with  Î» chosen by cross-validation.



###################### Model 6- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ####################

#Check Multicollinearity. If VIF>5 Multicollinearity exists.
vif(model1)

## Why PCA ? ###
# When there is high multicollinearity in the data one of the method to deal with severe multicollinearity is 'Principal Component Regression'.
# PCA uses correlation structure of original variables and derives p linear combinations which are uncorrelated.

# Because PCA works best with numerical data, you'll exclude the two categorical variables 
#Eliminating Dependent variables for further analysis.Note- Dependent variable should not be taken into account during PCA
drops <- ("cabinet_proportion")
vars <- data_num[ , !(names(data_num) %in% drops)]

# run pca and scale vars in same function call for a 2 latent var model
vars.pca <- prcomp(vars, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

# look at summary of results of pca -- most salient thing is % variance explained by each latent variable
summary(vars.pca)
#Inference- First Principal Component explains 22% of the variation.

# now look at loadings of raw variables in vars on the latent vars -- note it separates into pass vs run as expected
vars.pca
# First Principal Component can be interpreted as "power variable of a partyâ€Ÿ since all variables have similar loadings.

# list data in the object generated by the pca -- this is purely informational
attributes(vars.pca)

# show data in pca -- we have two latent variables 
vars.pca$x

# add data from pca to original set
# and of course, by hand, you should go through several rows starting with data, then inc, then the pca additions and check manually that there's no mistakes anywhere
# and instead of doing this with the $ operator, one can use inc["pc1"] = vars.pca$x[,"PC1"]... instead
inc$pc1 = vars.pca$x[,"PC1"]
inc$pc2 = vars.pca$x[,"PC2"]
